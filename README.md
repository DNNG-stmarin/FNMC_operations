# FNMC_operations
Created 09/18/2018
author: Stefano Marin for the DNNG (Prof. Sara Pozzi research group)

This project aims at putting together all the instructions to operate the FNMC in an intuitive way. The scripts presented here have been developed by Matthew J. Marcath while at the University of Michigan. Most codes have been developed during his Ph.D. period, between 2015 and 2018. I (Stefano Marin) have inherited these scripts once Matthew graduated. 

The fast neutron multiplicity counter is an organic-scintillator--based detector system that can be used to assay nuclear materials.

List of scripts included:

- calibOTF.py
- loadPSD.py
- MakeCCs.py
- processData.py
- pulsePlotter_v1.py

A library developed by Matthew J. Marcath and Marc Ruch called "pywaves" is also included. This includes all the functionality required for the above scripts to run smoothly.
